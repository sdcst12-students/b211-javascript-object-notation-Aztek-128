#Use the Weather API builder at https://open-meteo.com/en/docs to generate an API call for a city. 
# We are going to make use of the REQUESTS.Request method to retrieve this data and unpack it with 
# json.loads into a variable that we can use. Retrieve the data and present it in a more organized format. 
# You may use text output or a window using Tkinter. 
#Our goal is to format the result in a reasonably organized format.
